# Fine-Tuning Medical Chatbot with LLMs and Hugging Face

**Fine-Tuning Medical Chatbot with LLMs and Hugging Face** is a project where a pre-trained language model (LLM) is fine-tuned using medical datasets to create a chatbot capable of providing medical assistance.
## Features

- Pre-trained LLM: Leverages Hugging Face’s transformers for fine-tuning the model.
- Medical Dataset: The chatbot is trained using medical texts to handle medical-related queries.
- Interactive Chatbot: Responds to queries regarding general health, symptoms, and medical conditions.
- Data Augmentation: Uses data augmentation techniques to enhance the chatbot’s responses.
## Requirements 

- Python 3.x
 
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
   pip install transformers datasets torch
## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
  ```bash
git clone <repository-link>
cd medical-chatbot-llm
 ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python fine_tune_chatbot.py
## How it works:

1. Dataset Preparation: The model is fine-tuned on a medical dataset using Hugging Face’s transformers library.
2. Model Fine-Tuning: The pre-trained model is fine-tuned using medical texts, improving its responses for medical queries.
3. Interactive Chat: After training, the chatbot is able to interact with users, answering questions related to medical topics.
## Results

- Improved Responses: The chatbot provides relevant and accurate responses based on the medical knowledge it was trained on.
- Training Metrics: The training performance can be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, loss, and perplexity.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model on unseen data to ensure it generalizes well to new queries.
## Future enhancements

- Expand Dataset: Add more medical knowledge to the dataset to improve the chatbot’s responses.
- Multilingual Support: Incorporate multilingual datasets for global usage.
- Integration: Integrate the chatbot into healthcare applications for real-world use.
